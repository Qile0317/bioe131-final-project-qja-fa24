# Final project for BIOE 131: Fall 2024

This repository contains a cli tool that acts as a database installer for a collection of COVID-19 viral sequences from across the world. There is also a web interface that allows users to search for sequences by country, date, and other parameters.

## Local installation

```bash
git clone <THIS_PAGES_URL>.git
cd <THIS_REPOS_TITLE>

# TODO code for local installation

# initialize the web interface on localhost:3000
cd website
npm run build
#npm run export
npm run serve # then open up browser at port 3000
```
